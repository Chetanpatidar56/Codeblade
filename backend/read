to check for where token exist or not in redis

use command - (function name).exists(`token:${token}`);
use (function name).set(`token:${token}`,'blocked');
use (function name).expireAt(`token:${token}`,payload.exp);


we have used redis to store the tokens once user logout the token get store in redis db to blocked it for forever
if somebody else come with the same token can not access the data of the same person,
it provides the higher user security and authentication and let user data safe.
the token do have their own expire and will get delete from the redis db after expiry period.
It solves the porblem of user data access by somebody else and also let identify blocked token to not 
provide authorization to user data.


task we have completed today
1. learned how redis db works and why to use it for logout.
2. application like instagram, whatsapp and similar ones where user access their accounts frequently 
are the one uses these refresh token user authentication that have two tokens one is access and second
is refresh token. It improves the security and prevents accessing of data via tokens.
3. how to connect redis db to server along with mongoose db
4. when user log out the token has to be removed so that user will not be able to access any other functionality.
5.jwt token contains header, payload,and digitalsignature
6. payload contains user id,email, iat and exp time of the token- that make each and every single
token unique. 
summary-
every single time user login and register new unique token is created and when user logout the token has
be removed so that from the very same token no other resources can be accessed. For the reason to provide
data safety and intgrity over the system we have created.
